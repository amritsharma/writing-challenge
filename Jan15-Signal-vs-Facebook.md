## Elon Leads Exodus of Millions from Whatsapp to Signal (And It Crashed!)

Tens of millions of people worldwise have scrambled away from Whatsapp in recent days. Spooked by the announcement of a new data sharing policy between Whatsapp and it's less-than-honorable parent company, Facebook, sent them rushing for the door. With more than 2 billion users, Whatapp is the most popular messaging app in the world. This past week has called into question whether the network effects that kepts many of us in Whatsapp are really as strong as we had thought.

The exodus from Whatsapp accelerated when Dogecoin CEO and wealthiest man in the world, Elon Musk, tweeted "Use Signal".

Elon's tweet sent Signal to the top of the "most downloaded" rankings in many countries. Tens of millions have already fled to the privacy-first messaging app that has strong end-to-end encryption and want to deliver targeted ads to it's users.

Unfortunately, despite boldstering their infrastructure by "adding servers as fast as [they] can", Signal buckled under the pressure of the millions of new users and crashed. It is still down and unavailable. 

Surpringly, instead of venting their frustration, users turned to Twitter to shower Signal with [words](https://twitter.com/igautambiswas/status/1350122500277956608
) of [encouragement](https://twitter.com/cordyceps12/status/1350119313693413379) [and](https://twitter.com/simonthetwit/status/1350119672771969024) [support](https://twitter.com/vyashole/status/1350263494399062017).

Meanwhile, Elon Musk butted in once again with some commentary about Signal's server-side code.

## Whatsapp in Damage Control

Whatsapp and Facebook are in damage control mode with a misinformation campaign to address what they call "rumors". Their PR team is working overtime getting stories in popular industry blogs and in a rare move, they're buying (instead of selling) ads, including full page ads on the frontpages of Indian newspapers. 

Yes, Indian newspapers have ads on the front page. Sometimes the first several pages are ads. True story. But that's a tale for another day.

Facebook "respecting and protecting user's privacy" is a joke that doesn't even have to be made. Whether it's [violating individual privacy and copyright infringement with FaceMash](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/24/19-year-old-mark-zuckerberg-on-privacy-issues-versus-today.html), [stealing the idea for Facebook from the Winkevoss Twins](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/03/the-duplicitous-deeds-of-mark-zuckerberg/346445/), bait-and-switch on brand Pages by plummeting organic reach to zero, [weaponizing APIs to stifle competition](https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/11/facebooks-alleged-use-of-apis-to-crush-competition-is-a-warning-to-other-data-companies/), lying during Whatapp acquisition to EU saying it would be ["technically impossible"](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/12/20/facebook-charged-misleading-eu-19bn-whatsapp-deal/) to merge the two social networks, and on and on... 

Jeez. I wonder why people don't trust Facebook's new privacy policy for Whatsapp.

Good luck to the SRE team at Signal who have their hands full trying to get their systems up and running again.
