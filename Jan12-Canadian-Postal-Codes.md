## Part 1: What I think it is

It's embarrassing but I must confess - I have never once been able to correct recall my postal code from memory! By the time I get close to memorizing the postal code, I end up moving to a new place. Ugh. I probably need to enter my postal codes online during a checkout flow about twice a month. I love websites that autofill my city, postal code and country infromation once I've entered my address. Unfortunately that doesn't happen too often. My ritual is to instinctively open a new tab, enter my address and hit enter to search for it on google, then hover my cursor over the postal code, select and copy it, close the tab and back at the website I started. This adventure to grab my postal code lasts for about 5 seconds. 

What does a Canadian postal code look like anyway? It's a 6-digit string that starts with an M followed by numbers and letter alternating. The format is generally: `M + number + letter + space + number + letter + number`. For example: M3B 1Z8.

In the United States, ZIP codes are 5-digit numbers that generally increase from numbers starting with 0 in Maine in the North East corner of the country and increase all the way across the country till the North West corner (and Alaska).
