## Part 1: My Perception

It's embarrassing but I must confess - I have never once been able to recall my postal code from memory when I need it! Maybe it's because by the time I get close to memorizing what it is, I end up moving to a new place. Ugh. 

Postal codes are weird. I only need to enter this combination of letters and numbers during the checkout flow on website, about twice a month. I love websites that use Shop Pay because it autofills my city, postal code and country once I've entered my address. Unfortunately that doesn't happen too often. 

My ritual is to instinctively open a new tab, enter my address and hit enter to search for it on google, then hover my cursor over the postal code, select and copy it, close the tab and return to the website I started on. This adventure to grab my postal code takes roughly 5 seconds. That's what I have had to do so far.

What does a Canadian postal code look like anyway? It's a 6-digit string that starts with an 'M' followed by numbers and letter alternating. The format is generally: `M + number + letter + space + number + letter + number`. For example: M3B 1Z8.

In the United States, ZIP codes are 5-digit numbers that generally increase from numbers starting with 0 in Maine in the North East corner of the country and increase across the country Westward. I wonder if Postal Codes have a similar system. Let's find out what it is.

### Part 2: The Reality

Be right back. Let me go google it.
