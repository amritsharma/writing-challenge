## API is the New Storefront!

Application Programming *Interface*.

Remember storefronts?

Before COVID-19 upended our lives, we used to walk down the street and sometimes a shiny new gadget, dress or object would catch our eye, enticing us to walk into the store and peruse what they had to offer? That is a storefront. It was the primary interface for many businesses, especially mom and pop stores.

APIs are now becoming the primary interface for more and more businesses. Let me explain. But first, a history lesson:

In early 1900s, Henry Ford was building car factories. He became one of the richest men in the world by doing so successfully. His Model T automobile ushered in a new era of transporation in America.

Since there was noone else, there wasn't much of a car industry.

Henry Ford and his team had to build factories that did everything. 

water, coal and iron ore. --> cars. 

They literally did everything, because they had to.

They were pioneers. They couldn't turn to a specialized company that only made car seats or steering wheels or windshielf wipers and so on. The "input" to the factory were water, coal and iron ore. The "output", as you'd imagine, was cars.

Fast forward a few decades.

Now there are companies that are dedicated to building and selling just springs, wheels or nuts. Why? The car market is large enough, i.e. lots of people are buying cars from an increasing number of car companies. These are car companies interested in buying a specific part. Earlier this just wasn't the case, a company dedicated to making just windshield wipers just wouldn't survive because there wasn't enough demand for cars and hence windshield wipers weren't a viable company in and of itself. 

Computers. 

Computer company in 1970s would have to build everything. But in 1990s, the market grew larger and new companies emerged that could focus on just the hardware or software pieces.
