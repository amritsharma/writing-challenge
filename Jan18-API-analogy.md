## API is the New Storefront!

Application Programming *Interface*.

Remember storefronts?

Before COVID-19 upended our lives, we used to walk down the street and sometimes a shiny new gadget, dress or object would catch our eye, enticing us to walk into the store and peruse what they had to offer? That is a storefront. It was the primary *interface* for many businesses, especially mom and pop stores.

APIs are now becoming the primary interface for more and more businesses. 

Let me explain. 

But first, a history lesson:

In early 1900s, Henry Ford was building car factories for his Ford Model T automobile. It was the first of it's kind and it's resounding success made him one of the richest men in the world.

However, since he was the first one to try this out, the Ford factories had to make pretty much everything. 

They literally did everything, because they had to.

They were pioneers. They couldn't turn to a specialized companies that only made car seats or steering wheels or windshielf wipers and so on. The "input" to the factory were water, coal and iron ore. The "output", as you'd imagine, was cars.

Fast forward a few decades. Now there are companies that are dedicated to building and selling just springs, wheels or cameras for cars. 

Why? Because now the car market is large enough, i.e. lots of people are buying cars from an increasing number of car companies. Previously these car companies had to build each of these parts themselves, but now because there's considerably more demand (i.e. a larger market), other companies can specialize in this one part and sell it to all the the car companies. It's a win-win! 

Computers went through a very similar trend. 

Computer companies in 1970s would have to build everything. But in 1990s, as the market grew larger and new companies emerged that could focus on just the hardware or software pieces, companies started to focus on just the hardware or the software. 

Over the last decade we have been experiencing a new shift where software companies no longer have to do it all themselves. As you can imagine, there is a lot of overlap between systems across different companies. 

Today enough companies need to collect payment online, send email, sent text messages or give directions on maps. Therefore entire companies have emerged, some of them worth billions of dollars, that can focus on just one of these functions.

These specialized software functions are made available and delivered as an API.

Want to collect payment online? There's the Stripe API.
Want to send email? SendGrid.
want to send SMS messages? Twilio.
Want to give directions? Google Maps API.
Want to check the weather? OpenWeatherMap API.
and so on...
