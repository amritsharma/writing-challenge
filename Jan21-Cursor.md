Have you ever thought about how small the cursor is?

Honestly, take a look. It's tiny. I hadn't given it a second of thought until a couple days ago when I came across a tweet by Scott Hanselman.

If you, like me, are on a Mac, here are the step-by-step instructions for you. 

Open up the "Accessibility" panel in "System Preferences".

Accessibility > Display > Cursor size. Then adjust the slider.

Pro Tip: To quickly adjust the cursor size and make other changes, select the "Show Accessibility status in menu bar" at the bottom of the Accessibility panel.
