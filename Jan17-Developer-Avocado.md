## How Developer Advocates Became Developer Avocados? ðŸ¥‘

Yesterday I was listening to the [Conversations With Bacon](https://open.spotify.com/show/3ctdqzv045voVNMstm2qMz) Podcast where the host Jono Bacon interviews [Mary Thengvall](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/conversations-with/mary-thengvall-on-developer-R2PniqNhYeV/) about all things Developer Relations.

The hour-long discussion conversation touched on key aspects such as:

1. How to measure and report Dev Rel success to the Board?
2. Does it belong in Tech or Marketing?
3. Why companies struggle with their first Dev Rel hire?
4. Whether you need to have a development background to be a Developer Advocate?

To end the podcast on a ligher note, Bono asked Mary to explain what is up with all the avocados!

In Dev Rel circles Developer Advocate are sometimes called Developer Avocado. 
TKTK spoke fast and sometimes mispronounced it. 
It caught on.


Developer Relations in a company is similar to avocados. It's a fat department, but if used correct, it can be the good kind of fat. Fat budgets: flights, conferences, sponsorships, longer time horizon, perceived as fun, ...


In French, the word for advocate and avocado is the same.
