## How Developer Advocates Became Developer Avocados? ðŸ¥‘

While walking along Lake Ontario yesterday, I was listening to the [Conversations With BACON](https://open.spotify.com/show/3ctdqzv045voVNMstm2qMz) Podcast where the host Jono Bacon interviews [Mary Thengvall](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/conversations-with/mary-thengvall-on-developer-R2PniqNhYeV/). The hour-long discussion touched of many key aspects of Developer Relations, including:

1. How to measure and report Dev Rel success to a company's Board?
2. Whether it belongs in Tech or Marketing?
3. Why companies often struggle with their first Dev Rel hire?
4. Whether you need to have a development background to be a Developer Advocate?

Towards the end the podcast, Jono asked Mary to explain what is up with all the avocados in the Developer Relations world! Mary's the perfect person to ansewr this question because she was there when "Developer Avocados" was first coined and well, this is the cover of her book.

It all started when Mary worked at [SparkPost](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/), an email API company based in SF. At the time, the team was called Developer Advocacy and a Project Manager who tended to speak quickly often slipped up and said "Developer Avocadoes" instead. 

It happened enough times that the team decided to change their name to "Developer Avocados" because it's "more fun" than Developer Advocacy.

As you'd imagine, it confused the hell out of the rest of the company though. "Avocados? Huh!?" Mary and her team came up with an analogy to explain it to them.

> "As an industry, Developer Relations is viewed as an expensive department. We attend conferences, sponsor events and travel often. We have a hefty budget. In other words, we are a fatty departement. But -- if we are used in the right ways, at the right times, and with the right combination of other things, we can be the good kind of fat."

She continued, 

> "Because we can be healthy for both the community and the company."

Kinda like avocadoes! 

Since then, over the years, others have come up with many more ways to explain away why Developer Advocates are like avocadoes. Quite interestingly, in French, the word for *avocado* is the same word for *advocate*! How cool is that?

Fun fact: Internally at [ecobee](https://www.ecobee.com/), I built a series of slack bots that automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks. It's called guac. :)
