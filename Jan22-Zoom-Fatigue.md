## Zoom Fatigue Is Wearing Me Down (And This Is How I'm Fighting It!)

2020 was weird.

Ok fine. That's an obvious understatement.

Here we are, a couple weeks into 2021 and COVID-19 is still raging through the world. Here in Ontario we're under the strictest lockdowns since the start of the pandemic. I was still holding out on hope that it would somehow magically go away because 2020 is over. 

COVID-19 has claimed more than 2,000,000 lives, upended livelihoods, disrupted pretty much everything and confined many of us to our homes. I know that "we are all in this together" is a platitude that missed the mark. We are not equally affected by the the health and economic impact of this disease. 

I am very lucky that I am able to work remotely from the comfort of my home. My 40 minute commute has shrunk to a little trot down a flight of stairs from my bedroom. I am grateful to have been largely spared by this pandemic.

I know, I know - Zoom Fatigue is a first world problem.

Although this pales in comparison to the many other challenging and pressing issues in the world today, it is real nonetheless.

Let's talk about it.

We're closing in on a whole year since the pandemic ushered in this Remote First work culture and I am tired of video calls. Utterly exhausted. I looked it up - it turns out that I'm not the only one. Heck, there's even some real psychological reasons about why we're struggling with it.

Exhibit A: Psychiatric Times. https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/psychological-exploration-zoom-fatigue

> In an effort to understand this new fatigue that may tax the more than 300 million daily participants of Zoom, experts representing diverse disciplines including acoustics, business, and the social sciences have contributed their explanations. For instance, audio has been proposed as the main reason that video meetings are draining. It turns out that millisecond delays in virtual verbal responses negatively affect our interpersonal perceptions, even without any internet or technical issues.

Who would have thought? The micro delay between when someone on your call says something and when you hear it makes a difference.

> There is robust evidence on how eye contact improves connection—faster responses, more memorization of faces, and increased likeability and attractiveness. These tools that make interactions organically rewarding are compromised over video. On video, gaze must be directed at the camera to appear like making eye contact with an observer, and during conferences with 3 or more people, it can be impossible to distinguish mutual gaze between any 2 people.

This unwritten rule that I must gaze at the camera or my screen in order to *appear* engaged takes away from actually being engaged in the conversation.

> Biologically, video conferencing is confounded by a more sedentary daily rhythm experienced during the pandemic. Notably, physical activity is associated with about a 40% reduced risk of fatigue.

> Psychologists say several factors lead to Zoom fatigue. Users can feel like they're performing for the camera more than they would while meeting colleagues in person — especially when software continuously displays to a user their own live image, adding an element of self-awareness.

> Marissa Shuffler, an assistant professor in industrial-organizational psychology at South Carolina's Clemson University, calls it "having to be 'on' all the time."

Exhibit C: Symptoms of Zoom Fatigue. https://blog.otter.ai/zoom-fatigue/

> Feelings of “burnout” (i.e. feeling overworked and exhausted)
> Depression
> Anxiety
> Pessimism
> Anger
> Social detachment
> Lack of motivation
> Difficulty concentrating
> Sensitivity to light or sound
> Headaches or migraines
> Low productivity

I know others on my team have complained about one or more of these symptoms as of late. It may or may not be directly caused by Zoom Fatigue, but it certainly doesn't help.

### So, how am I trying to fix it?

It's a 2 step process:

#### 1. Turning off my camera. 

It helps me be more engaged in the meeting because I'm not performing for the camera. "Performing" as in - looking at the camera, facing my laptop, sitting upright, smiling to try and convey signals of engagement. There are exceptions of course - cameras are fine in 1:1 meetings, and sometimes even in short pow wow sessions where you and a few others are actively troubleshooting a problem over a few minutes, but that's the exception to the rule.

The passive aggressive "I don't want you to feel pressured into turning your camera on" is perhaps the only thing that grinds my gears more than video calls themselves.

#### 2. Turn off all incoming video!

I recently discovered this feature in Microsoft Teams and I love it. All my meetings have become phone calls now. I know this is not a very popular idea at most companies, including my own. But it has worked wonders. This feature was presumably built for users with a shaky network connection, but it serves this purpose too.

I don't know whether this approach of turning off videos during long meetings will help me keep Zoom Fatigue at bay. Only time will tell.
