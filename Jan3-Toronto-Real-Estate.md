## A Toronto couple just bought this $1.2-million semi in the Upper Beaches

Max Schreiber, 34, data scientist at Rogers; Kyra A. Gleason, 33, doctor at Humber River Hospital.

#### The story
In 2018, Max and Kyra started renting a one-bed, one-den, one-bath condo near Yorkdale Mall for $2,100. They didn't particularly enjoy living in the area, although being quite close to the mall and the Yorkdale TTC station was some consolation. The pandemic changed their quality of life equation when they were both forced to work from home miles away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Stuck inside for most of the day, Max and Kyra longed for big light-letting windows or a backyard where they could get some fresh air without having to gear up with PPE first. That got them thinking about upsizing. 

Of course, it wasn't the first time this thought had crossed their mind. Lamenting about the ever rising real estate prices in the GTA area while [*zillow surfing*](https://marker.medium.com/zillow-surfing-has-become-a-primary-form-of-escapism-for-those-who-want-to-flee-not-just-their-857de638cf3f) and dreading how the mortgage payments would eat into their paycheques was a regular topic of conversation at their dinner table. 

On September 27, Kyra nonchalantly shared a realtor.ca link of a three-bedroom three-bathroom townhouse in Regent Park with Max. This wasn't unusual, they had bounced MLS listings of homes for sale back and forth a quite a few times before. Somehow this one set off a series of unplanned and unexpected events that led them to ... you guessed it... buying a house within the next few days!


#### Option 1: Regent Park (near Dundas and Parliament). Listed at $798,000, sold for $1,000,000.
[62 Cole St, Toronto, ON M5A 0A8](https://housesigma.com/web/en/house/56k97wqJXMxYKRjD/62-Cole-St-Toronto-M5A0A8-C4924295)
3 bedrooms. 3 bathrooms. Townhouse. $436/mo maintenance fee.

Max and Kyra both appreciated this newly renovated townhouse which was just steps away from the Regent Park Aquatic Center and various other amenities. The place lacked a front or back yard, but had a balcony overlooking the parking lot to the North. The highlight of the main level was the spacious kitchen and living room with an open concept layout, which was beautifully staged. They could practically see themselves hosting parties for their friends here already. There was a garage in the basement, but guest parking otherwise would be a hassle. They experienced this first hand when their realtor, Jeff Gates, parked his Tesla Model Y illegally on a nearby street that required a parking pass. Kyra noted that the bedrooms were smaller than she wanted, but this was typical for all new'ish builds in Toronto. Max was glad to see such a decent house for sale in the downtown core within their budget, but the stack of realtor business cards on the kitchen table sombered the mood when their own realtor informed them that leaving business cards behind was an industry norm. Max and Kyra anticipated a bidding war on this property but walked out of there encouraged regardless. They weren't jumping out of their boots to make an offer - at least not until they had seen the three other homes they had on their itinerary for the evening.

#### Option 2: East China Town (near Dundas and DVP). Listed at $799,999, sold for $810,000.
[24 Florence Wyle Ln, Toronto, ON](https://housesigma.com/web/en/house/K8OgYBVpWe6YJmG2/24-Florence-Wyle-Lane-5-Toronto-M4M3E7-E4927479)
2 bedrooms. 2 bathrooms. Townhouse. $273/mo maintenance fee.

After a short drive to the other side of the DVP, Max and Kyra walked up to a bizarrely thin two-bed, two-bath townhouse near the East China Town neighborhood. The staircases in the home were steep, bedrooms tiny and each floor was crammed for space. Max loved the rooftop though. Can you believe it? This townhouse had a roof overlooking the Toronto skyline, including the CN Tower. Kyra quietly walked around the townhouse knowing full well that they weren't going to be making an offer on this house. Max, Kyra and their realtor trekked down the stairs and exited the townhouse, careful not to accidentally let the fluffy black house cat out as well. 

#### Option 3: Riverside Neighborhood (near Queen St and Coxwell Ave). Listed at $799,900, sold for $870,000.
[33 Coxwell Ave, Toronto](https://housesigma.com/web/en/house/Zaw5Yo5VoDp7n961/33-Coxwell-Ave-Toronto-M4L3A9-E4926904)
3 bedrooms. 2 bathrooms. Detached house. No maintenance fee.

This house made quite an impression on Max and Kyra. This detached(!) house was painted black except for the front door, which was bright red. Max couldn't help but humm "Paint it, black" by the Rolling Stones as they walked into the newly gutted and renovated house on Carlaw Ave. You could practically smell the fresh paint and new appliances throughout the house. The house felt new but more than a few rough edges. The master bedroom on the upper level had a slanted roof that made only half of the floor space accessible by foot. The other two bedrooms were in the basement and would fit little more than a Queen sized bed. The hightlight of this house was the expansive back yard that was the biggest they had thought imaginable in downtown. Although the house didn't live up their expectations, Kyra and Max imagined the possibilities of this backyard from summer BBQs to renting out a tent on airbnb. It was already getting dark at this point and mosquitos were trying to swarm into the house and enjoy the warmth of the light bulbs. Max and Kyra were unsure whether they would enjoy making this place home and set off to look at the last property of the day.


#### The buy: Mortimer Ave (near Danforth and Coxwell). Listed at $899,900, sold for $918,000.

2 bedrooms. 2 bathrooms. Semi-detached house. No maintenance fee.

The sun had set long before they arrived at this house, but their luck had started to shine bright. This all white interior was plush with freshly painted walls, seemingly new and fancy appliances and not your average fin   It was dark aTlready when the realLater that day, the Moores made a stop at this three-bed, two-bath semi in the Upper Beaches. It was in excellent condition and had a large backyard. Plus, there was a playground and a dog park across the street, both of which would be perfect for Raffy and their future family. Another bonus: the finished basement could be converted into a TV room and a gym. To eliminate the kind of competition they encountered earlier in their search, Bobby and Eric made another aggressive initial bid at $205,100 over asking. That narrowed the field to two matching offers. But this time, the Moores were willing to go a bit higher. They threw in another $13,000 and sealed the deal.

Bobby and Eric will make the move in early November. Aside from painting the home’s exterior panels and replacing the front door, they also plan on installing his-and-hers sinks in the master bathroom. They expect all of that to cost anywhere from $5,000 to $13,000. And finally: one of the bedrooms, which they want to convert into an office, has a west-facing window that gets plenty of natural light—the perfect place to work-from-home during the winter months.
