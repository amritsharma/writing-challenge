## A Toronto couple just bought this $1.2-million semi in the Upper Beaches

A two-bed, two-bath semi in the Upper Beaches

#### The story
In 2018, Max and Kyra started renting a one-bed, one-den, one-bath condo near Yorkdale Mall for $2,100. They didn't particularly enjoy living in the area, although being quite close to the mall and the Yorkdale TTC station was some consolation. The pandemic changed their quality of life equation when they were both forced to work from home miles away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Stuck inside for most of the day, Max and Kyra longed for big light-letting windows or a backyard where they could get some fresh air without having to gear up with PPE first. That got them thinking about upsizing. 

Of course, it wasn't the first time this thought had crossed their mind. Lamenting about the ever rising real estate prices in the GTA area while [*zillow surfing*](https://marker.medium.com/zillow-surfing-has-become-a-primary-form-of-escapism-for-those-who-want-to-flee-not-just-their-857de638cf3f) and dreading how the mortgage payments would eat into their paycheques was a regular topic of conversation at their dinner table. 

On September 27, Kyra nonchalantly shared a realtor.ca link of a three-bedroom three-bathroom townhouse in Regent Park with Max. This wasn't unusual, they had bounced MLS listings of homes for sale back and forth a quite a few times before. Somehow this one set off a series of unplanned and unexpected events that led them to ... you guessed it... buying a house within the next few days!


#### Option 1: Regent Park (near Dundas and Parliament). Listed at $798,000, sold for $1,000,000.
[62 Cole St, Toronto, ON M5A 0A8](https://housesigma.com/web/en/house/56k97wqJXMxYKRjD/62-Cole-St-Toronto-M5A0A8-C4924295)
3 bedrooms. 3 bathrooms. Townhouse. $436/mo maintenance fee.

Max and Kyra both appreciated this newly renovated townhouse which was just steps away from the Regent Park Aquatic Center and various other amenities. The place lacked a front or back yard, but had a balcony overlooking the parking lot to the North. The highlight of the main level was the spacious kitchen and living room with an open concept layout, which was beautifully staged. They could practically see themselves hosting parties for their friends here already. There was a garage in the basement, but guest parking otherwise would be a hassle. They experienced this first hand when their realtor, Jeff Gates, parked his Tesla Model Y illegally on a nearby street that required a parking pass. Kyra noted that the bedrooms were smaller than she wanted, but this was typical for all new'ish builds in Toronto. Max was glad to see such a decent house for sale in the downtown core within their budget, but the stack of realtor business cards on the kitchen table sombered the mood when their own realtor informed them that leaving business cards behind was an industry norm. Max and Kyra anticipated a bidding war on this property but walked out of there encouraged regardless. They weren't jumping out of their boots to make an offer - at least not until they had seen the three other homes they had on their itinerary for the evening.

#### Option 2: East China Town (near Dundas and DVP). Listed at $799,999, sold for $810,000.
[24 Florence Wyle Ln, Toronto, ON](https://housesigma.com/web/en/house/K8OgYBVpWe6YJmG2/24-Florence-Wyle-Lane-5-Toronto-M4M3E7-E4927479)
2 bedrooms. 2 bathrooms. Townhouse. $273/mo maintenance fee.

After a short drive to the other side of the DVP, Max and Kyra walked up to a bizarrely thin two-bed, two-bath townhouse near the East China Town neighborhood. The staircases in the home were steep, bedrooms tiny and each floor was crammed for space. Max loved the rooftop though. Can you believe it? This townhouse had a roof overlooking the Toronto skyline, including the CN Tower. Kyra quietly walked around the townhouse knowing full well that they weren't going to be making an offer on this house. Max, Kyra and their realtor trekked down the stairs and exited the townhouse, careful not to accidentally let the fluffy black house cat out as well. 

#### Option 3: Riverside Neighborhood (near Queen St and Coxwell Ave). Listed at $799,900, sold for $870,000.
[33 Coxwell Ave, Toronto](https://housesigma.com/web/en/house/Zaw5Yo5VoDp7n961/33-Coxwell-Ave-Toronto-M4L3A9-E4926904)
2+2 bedrooms. 1 bathroom. Detached house. No maintenance fee.

This house made quite an impression on Max and Kyra. This detached(!) house was painted black except for the front door, which was bright red. Max couldn't help but humm "Paint it, black" by the Rolling Stones as they walked into the newly gutted and renovated house on Carlaw Ave. You could practically smell the fresh paint and new appliances throughout the house. The house felt new but more than a few rough edges. The master bedroom on the upper level had a slanted roof that made only half of the floor space accessible by foot. The other two bedrooms were in the basement and would fit little more than a Queen sized bed. The hightlight of this house was the expansive back yard that was the biggest they had thought imaginable in downtown. Although the house didn't live up their expectations, Kyra and Max imagined the possibilities of this backyard from summer BBQs to renting out a tent on airbnb. It was already getting dark at this point and mosquitos were trying to swarm into the house and enjoy the warmth of the light bulbs. Max and Kyra were unsure whether they would enjoy making this place home and set off to look at the last property of the day.


#### The buy: Mortimer Ave (near Danforth and Coxwell). Listed at $899,900, sold for $918,000.
XXX Mortimer Ave, Toronto
2 bedrooms. 2 bathrooms. Semi-detached townhouse. No maintenance fee.

The sun had set long before they arrived at this house. Max and Kyra walked in and were greeted with a house that already felt like home. Was it love at first sight? After walking around the house, Kyra said "Do we have to leave?" Max was surprised at how much bang they were getting for their buck (at the list price) here. This house had an all white interior with freshly painted walls, seemingly new and fancy appliances and finishing touches that screamed comfort and luxury. It was in excellent condition. This three storey semi-detached townhouse had decent sized bedrooms, a finished basemeent, a manicured front yard, a modestly sized backyard and a combinbation of large windows and pot lights throughout the house. Plus, there was a playground and a dog park across the street, both of which would be perfect for when their friends visit with their furry companions. Another bonus: the finished basement meant that Kyra and Max wouldn't have to work next to each other and coordinate when they'd be on a call to not disturb each other. Max was skeptical that they could make a compelling enough offer on this house. "They're joking with us for listing this at only $899k," Max said. "It's nice that they let us mere mortals experience how people with nice houses in nice neighborhoods live. This one's going to go for at least a million!" Kyra wasn't going to participate in a bidding war but suggested that they made an offer they were comfortable with and see what happened. 

The following day, the seller countered Max and Kara's offer with a slightly higher price. Kara and Max agreed to their counter offer.

Kyra and Max went from nonchalantly zilliow browsing to having an offer accepted in 6 days flat. No bidding wars. No multiple trips with the realtor to check out houses for sale. No upgrades needed. No major repairs anticipated. Somehow Max and Kyra had a smooth experience buying real estate in Toronto. "Is this really happening?" Kyra exclaimed to Max. "I guess so," Max replied.
