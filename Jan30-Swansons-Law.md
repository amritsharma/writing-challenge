## Swanson's Law

Swanson's Law says that the price of solar panel tends to drop 20 percent for every doubling of cumulative shipped volume. In other words, as the world gets more proficient at making solar panels because there's more demand for them, they get cheaper. The drop in price in turn increasing the demand further, and the cycle continues.

It makes good sense too. 

As the demand for solar panels grows, we produce more of them, which allows us to learn how to make them more effectively and get to take advantage of what economists call "economies of scale". That allows us to build and these more cheaply.

In fact, Swanson's Law seems to undershoot the impact of these learnings as the price of solar panels have been dropped by 30-40% for every doubling in shipped volume lately.

Swanson's Law is often compared to Moore's Law.

Moore's law says that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. The result these doublings over the past 20 years that a smartphone today is not just a phone. It's a camera, GPS, video camera, alarm clocks and much more. If we didn't figure out how to put so many more transistors on an IC, we wouldn't have any of the reasonably sized and reasonably priced smart home products we rely on around our homes.

It's important to note a key difference between the two Laws. The x-axis for Moore's law is time, which makes it rather easy to understand. Whereas the drop in prices illustrated by Swanson's Law is a function of increasing shipments (i.e. demand/supply). The x-axis tends to be either cumulate shipped volume or installed solar volume.
