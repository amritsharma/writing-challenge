### Swanson's Law, Wright's Law and The Experience Curve

What is it?
Swanson's law says that the price of solar panels (solar photovoltaic modules) tends to drop 20 percent for every doubling of cumulative shipped volume.

It's interesting because the % drop in price for doubling in shipped volume remains constant even as the industry gets significantly larger.

Wiki: Due to economies of scale solar panels get less costly as people use and buy more—as manufacturers increase production to meet demand, the cost and price is expected to drop in the years to come. 

It's often compared to Moore's Law.

Moore's Law says that for every (blank) the (blank). The x-axis is time. While Swanson's Law is a function of time, but instead demand/supply (technically, shipments.)



Why is it called Swanson's Law? 
Mr. Swanson wasn't the first one to observe this trend.

What's Wright's Law?
Interestingly, Swanson's Law is simply one example of the Wright's Law. When the Wright's Law is applied to the price of solar panels, it's called the Swanson's Law.

Arguably Wright's Law is more interesting because it can be applied to many more situations.

Wright's Law is also called Experience Curve. Ex

It states that ... 

CNBC: Solar panel prices are dropping dramatically. The solar industry has its own variant of Moore’s Law, which says that the number of transistors (and hence the computing power) on an integrated circuit doubles every two years. Swanson’s Law says that the price of solar photovoltaic modules tends to drop 20 percent for every doubling of cumulative shipped volume. At present rates, costs drop 50 percent about every 10 years.
