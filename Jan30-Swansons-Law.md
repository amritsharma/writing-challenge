## Swanson's Law and The Experience Curve

Swanson's Law says that the price of solar panels* tends to drop 20 percent for every doubling of cumulative shipped volume. In other words, as the world gets more proficient at making solar panels, they get cheaper.

It makes good sense too. 

As the demand for solar panels grows, we produce more of them, which allows us to learn how to make them more effectively and get to take advantage of what economists call "economies of scale". That allows us to build and these more cheaply.

In fact, Swanson's Law seems to have underestimated the impact of these learnings as the price of solar panels have been dropped by 30-40% for every doubling in shipped volume.

Swanson's Law is often compared to Moore's Law.

Moore's law says that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. It is the result of many of these doublings over the past 20 years that a smartphone today is not just a phone. It's a camera, GPS, video camera, alarm clocks and much more.

It's important to note that the x-axis for Moore's law is time, which makes it rather easy to understand. Whereas the drop in prices illustrated by Swanson's Law is a function of increasing shipments (i.e. demand/supply). The x-axis tends to be either cumulate shipped volume or installed solar volume.
