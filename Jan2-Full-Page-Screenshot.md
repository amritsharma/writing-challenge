## How to Take a Full-Page Screenshot on Google Chrome?

Last week I was stuck. I couldn't figure out how to take a full page screenshot of a long webpage on Google Chrome. It was my order history on Amazon Canada - but it could be any website in your case.

Typically when I need to take a screenshot on my Mac, I summon Skitch with a quick search on Alfred and a couple clicks is all it takes. But that doesn't work if you need to take a full page screenshot.

I discovered the solution thanks to this [article](https://zapier.com/blog/full-page-screenshots-in-chrome/) by Emily Irish on Zapier's blog.

We're going to hop into the Developer Tools on Chrome to accomplish this.

## Step 1: Developer Tools
Hold down these three keys on your keyboard `Alt + Command + I` to reveal the Developer Tools panel in Google Chrome.

## Step 2: Command Menu
Open the Command Menu with this keyboard shortcut: `Command + Shift + P`. It looks like a textbox with a dropdown under it. 
The [Command Menu](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/command-menu) "provides a fast way to navigate the Chrome DevTools UI and accomplish common tasks."

## Step 3: Screenshot!
Type `screenshot` in the Command Menu textbox and select `Capture full size screenshot` from the dropdown.

That's it. Chrome will save a PNG file with the screenshot into your Downloads folder.
