#### Change of Plans.

Today I am going to write about the joy of reading a newspaper instead. 

---

1. Edit some of these articles.

2. Ponder if I should cross post them somewhere else? Medium? DevTO? LinkedIn?

3. Reflect on this month. Lessons Learned. Mistakes made. What's next month?

- naming github files. Jan10 shows up above Jan2. Ugh. Renaming Jan2 to Jan02 would have broken existing links.

- sleep

- Incomplete. 

- Often ran out of time and will to write a proper conclusion.

- First drafts are supposed to suck. Just get them out. A crappy first draft (or even just an outline) is not a blank document. Goodbye writer's block.

- Commas. Ugh. 

- I would start a sentence just fine, but then I would say "but". Over and over again! 

- So glad I did this. I'm proud of myself. <pats self on back>

- Twitter thread. Joe Pomp style was new to me and I can see how/why his twitter engagement is through the roof since he joined the site a few months ago. Twitter threads are not just a stream of consciousness. Don't let anyone tell you any different. 

- I didn't write satire. That was a missed opportunity. https://medium.com/@amrit_sharma/snoring-villager-annoys-everyone-in-community-shelter-4e1c14f31fb8 

4. Write a README for this repo.
