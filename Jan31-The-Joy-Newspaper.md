## The Joy of Reading a Newspaper

It was the 90s. Like clockwork, every morning I'd rush out to our balcony to grab the day's newspaper. 

Balcony!?

Yep. You see, in Kathmandu, if you have a newspaper subscription, the delivery person would bike to your house and chuck the rolled-up newspaper, like a broken boomerang, perfectly onto your front step or your balcony - whatever you preferred.

Our newspaper of choice was The Kathmandu Post, Nepal's largest selling English daily.

I don't remember my parents ever making me read the newspaper. It was something I thoroughly enjoyed.

Before I went to school, I'd sit in the sun and at least skim, if not read, every story in the newspaper. But before I'd get to the stories, I had to flip to the back of the newspaper for the Sports section. I loved to keep up with current affairs around the world. Most of the stories covered the latest happenings in Nepal, India, and other SAARC countries, but the newspaper did justice to significant stories from further away as well. I suppose the latter is due to wire services like Reuters and AP.

#### Fast Forward to 2021

A few hours ago, I was out buying eggs and bread at our corner grocery store when the colorful "BULL OR BUBBLE? headline on the front page of The Globe And Mail tempted me to make the $7 impulse purchase. 

SEVEN DOLLARS!?

Yep, the Saturday edition of the paper is more expensive than others days because it has bonus Arts & Pursuits, Business, and Opinion sections as well.

After dinner tonight, I sank into my couch with the stack of papers with me, while soothing indie music filled the living room. I was excited, almost giddy, to have an actual newspaper in my hands.

`Few distractions`

What struck me almost immediately is that my mind didn't wander anywhere nearly as much as it does when I am reading something online. I typically have dozens of tabs open on my Mac, several other applications, and getting pinged by the occasional notification. The most distracting thought was how there are so few distractions. I guess it helps that I didn't know where my phone was. I later found it deep inside my couch cushions. :)

`Data Viz`

The combination of colors, data visualization and thoughtful design, with the high caliber writing made the stories pop. On Page 2, I'm presuming everyday, there's a summary of COVID cases and deaths from around Canada. I learned that at least 3,740 people are being treated for COVID-19 in hospitals today. That is higher than I thought it would be.

The graphics on the "Canada's drinking problem" help make the numbers make sense. Particularly, the charts illustrating that not all drinks are creating equal. For instance, a strong beer (7%) tall can (473ml) is equivalent to 1.9 standard drink servings. 

Did you know that the only country with more lax alcohol guidelines is Spain. The recommended maximum weekly limit in 21 drinks for men and 13 for women. It's 15 and 10 for Canada. While Netherlands in comparison is a third of ours with 5 maximum drinks recommended per week for men and women alike.

`Information Retention!`

[Evidence](https://hechingerreport.org/evidence-increases-for-reading-on-paper-instead-of-screens/) shows that we retain more information after reading from paper instead of a screen. That may not be the case for everybody. I know people who have sworn off of books and consume them from their Kindles or iPads. I certainty am not one of them. I have always known this about myself. When I am reading on a screen. I tend to subconsciously gloss over the words and almost just glaze at several sentences. How else are you supposed to read everything on the internet?

Reading on paper, on the other hand, feels different.

I love the editorial checks and balances that a newsroom provides. It's so refreshing after consuming news online for so many years and having an exponentially harder time distinguishing the news from opinion, lies and conspiracy theories.   <3 

#### Fun fact

I went down a Wikipedia rabbit hole earlier because I was curious about The Globe and Mail's political leanings and history. I was surprised to find that the family that owns much of Thomson Reuters (hint: The Thomsons) owns 100% of The Globe and Mail, via their private holding company called [The Woodbridge Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Woodbridge_Company).
