## The Joy of Reading a Newspaper

It was the 90s. Like clockwork, every morning I'd rush out to our balcony to grab the day's newspaper. 

Balcony!?

Yep. You see, in Kathmandu, if you have a newspaper subscription, the delivery person would bike to your house and chuck the rolled up newspaper, like a broken boomerang, perfectly onto your front step or your balcony - whatever you prefered.

Our newspaper of choice was The Kathmandu Post, Nepal's largest selling English daily.

Before I went to school, I'd sit in the sun and at least skim, if not read, every story in the newspaper. But before I'd get to the stories, I had to flip to the back of the newspaper for the Sports section.

#### Fast Forward to 2021

While buying eggs and bread at our corner grocery store this evening, the colorful "BULL OR BUBBLE? headline on the front page of Saturday's The Globe And Mail was too tempting for me to pass up.

Reading a story online just isn't the same.



My mind didn't wander anywhere close to as much as it would if i was reading this article on a tab. There are dozens of other tabs open. The occasional notification somewhere.

But this was a pure experience with smooth indie music playing on the TV while I sat on the couch with Saturday's The Globe and Mail in my mind that I paid $7 for.

SEVEN DOLLARS!?

The Saturday edition is a bulky one. Besides the standard "news" chunk, there's the Art & Pursuits, Business and Opinion chunks as well.

I was going to write about something else, reflect on this past month, the wins, the lessons learned, the mistakes made, but I suppose I could still do that in a few days once this month-long experience has been marinating in my mind some more. 

Avid reader of The Kathmandu Post (link) every morning growing up. Grab the newspaper and sit in the sun at our home in Baluwatar. Start at the last page. Sports! Then USA, Nepal, India, SAARC, .. I wanted it all.
