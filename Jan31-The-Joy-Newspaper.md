## The Joy of Reading a Newspaper

Like clockwork, every morning I'd rush out to our balcony to grab the day's newspaper. 

Balcony!?

Yep. You see, in Kathmandu, if you have a newspaper subscription, the deliever person would bike from house to house and chuck rolled up newspapers, almost like a boomerang on a one-way mission, onto your front step's or your balcony - whatever you prefered.

Our newspaper of choice was The Kathmandu Post, Nepal's largest selling English daily.

I'd at least skim every story in the newspaper, if not read it through and through. But before I got to them, I had to flip to the back of the newspaper for the Sports section.

Climate change. Trees. Yadi yadi yada.

It's just not the same. 

My mind didn't wander anywhere close to as much as it would if i was reading this article on a tab. There are dozens of other tabs open. The occasional notification somewhere.

But this was a pure experience with smooth indie music playing on the TV while I sat on the couch with Saturday's The Globe and Mail in my mind that I paid $7 for.

SEVEN DOLLARS!?

The Saturday edition is a bulky one. Besides the standard "news" chunk, there's the Art & Pursuits, Business and Opinion chunks as well.

I was going to write about something else, reflect on this past month, the wins, the lessons learned, the mistakes made, but I suppose I could still do that in a few days once this month-long experience has been marinating in my mind some more. 

Avid reader of The Kathmandu Post (link) every morning growing up. Grab the newspaper and sit in the sun at our home in Baluwatar. Start at the last page. Sports! Then USA, Nepal, India, SAARC, .. I wanted it all.
