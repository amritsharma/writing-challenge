Let's go!

### The Postman API Hack
Hack the future of APIs and unleash what you can do.


### Challenge

We challenge you to not just create a Postman public workspace with a Collection of APIs, but build something that is creative, has compelling value to developers, addresses a problem, or has community interest.

### Idea: Morning Zen

Pandemic >> Stiff backs. Hunched over. Sedentary lifestyles. Zoom fatigue. Weather. Air quality report! Joke. Drink water. 

Kick your morning off by taking care of yourself with the Zen Morning Postman Collection.

Input: Your address. 

Brainstorming:

* :sun: Good morning. It's a new day! Close your eyes breathe in... hold.... breathe out! 

* Meditate for 5 minutes. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inpok4MKVLM

* Weather. 

* Air quality report. >> US EPA or WHO guidelines >> 

* Happy start to your day: Joke / **Eyebleach** / Aww / Cuteness.

* Drink water.

* Gratitude. One person. One thing. Say hi to a friend. What's that one thing you want to do today?

Publish it to your own private slack channel: #morningzen (or something else)

* Messages sent via Slack webhook.
