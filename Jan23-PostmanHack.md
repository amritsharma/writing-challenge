Let's go!

### The Postman API Hack
Hack the future of APIs and unleash what you can do.


### Challenge

We challenge you to not just create a Postman public workspace with a Collection of APIs, but build something that is creative, has compelling value to developers, addresses a problem, or has community interest.

### Idea: Morning Zen

You are amazing. APIs, collections, environments, mocks, monitors and more. Postman takes care of your APIs. Take care of yourself too. 

Pandemic >> Stiff backs. Hunched over. Sedentary lifestyles. Zoom fatigue. Weather. Air quality report! Joke. Drink water. 

Kick your morning off by taking care of yourself with the Zen Morning Postman Collection.

Input: Your address in the query parameter. 

What happens next?
1. Convert address to coordinates with Position Stack API.  
2. Grab weather forecast from OpenWeatherMap.
3. Grab air quality report from OpenAQ.
4. Make API call to reddit? Eyebleach.
5. Assemble the rest of the message.
6. Push to slack via webhook.
