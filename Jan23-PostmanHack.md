### The Postman API Hack
Hack the future of APIs and unleash what you can do.


### Challenge

We challenge you to not just create a Postman public workspace with a Collection of APIs, but build something that is creative, has compelling value to developers, addresses a problem, or has community interest.

### Idea: Morning Zen (Slack bot named Coco?)

You are amazing. APIs, collections, environments, mocks, monitors and more. Postman takes care of your APIs. Take care of yourself too. 

Pandemic >> Stiff backs. Hunched over. Sedentary lifestyles. Zoom fatigue. Weather. Air quality report! Joke. Drink water. 

Kick your morning off by taking care of yourself with the Zen Morning Postman Collection.

Input: Your address in the query parameter. 

What happens next?
1. Convert address to coordinates with Position Stack API. // DONE
2. Grab weather "Feels like" temperature from OpenWeatherMap. // DONE
3. Grab air quality report from OpenAQ. // API is down. Getting 504 Gateway Time-out.
4. Make API call to reddit? Eyebleach. // Not right now.
5. Assemble the rest of the message. // To do.
6. Push to slack via webhook. (Ideally it'd be with the Slack API. I could make it really nice like Guac.)

Brainstorming:

* :sun: Good morning sunshine, it's me, Coco! It's a new day! Close your eyes! inhale.... and ... exhale! 

* Meditate for 5 minutes. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inpok4MKVLM. or **egg timer**?

* Journal with Google Docs. https://doc.new/

* Weather. 

* Air quality report. >> US EPA or WHO guidelines >> Meets or does not meet standards.

* Happy start to your day: Joke / **Eyebleach** / Aww / Cuteness. >> Pug. https://unsplash.com/wallpapers/cute/pug

* ~Something to marvel at: NASA Photo of the Day,~

* Stretch -- [5 mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L2lnxIcNmo), [10 mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pKly2JojMw), [30 mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMu6OKF5Z1k), [Stretch at desk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAUf7aajBWE) or [Office break](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-8FvC3GD8c) or [PTs 10 stretches for office in 2 minutes](https://youtu.be/w1INfs260DY?t=490)

* Drink water.

* Gratitude. One person. One thing. Say hi to a friend. What's that one thing you want to do today?

Publish it to your own private slack channel: #morningzen (or something else)

* Messages sent via Slack webhook or the Slack API

Important:

1. Decide what the message will look like. Should Coco say everything or pick and choose one thing! 

2. Documentation. Documentation. Documentation. Make it amazing!

3. Submit team details.

4. Submit Coco to Postman before deadline 5pm PST.
