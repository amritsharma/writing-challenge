## Deflation

Getting more bang for your buck? Yes please! 

What could possibly be wrong about that?

One person's spending is another person's income.

Deflation is a vicious cycle. 

If deflation only meant falling prices and being able to afford for things, then yeah, deflation would be great. Unfortunately there are downstrem consequences of falling prices.

Here's what happens when the vicious cycle of deflation takes hold:

1. The price of *Product X* drops. 
2. You need to spend fewer Dollars, Rupees or Pesos to buy X.
3. The company that makes X suffers because they now make less money than they used to. Revenues drop. Profits drop.
4. Due to falling profits, the company resorts to reducing expenses by laying off workers.
5. Laid off employees don't have as much money anymore and have to cut back on expenses, i.e. demand falls.
6. Employees that survived the lay off round fear they may be next and tighten their belts as well, i.e demand falls even further.
7. As we learned in Economics 101, when demand falls, companies try to attract buyers by lowering their prices.
8. Lower prices? Wait a second. Isn't that where we started on Step 1 of this vicious cycle?



Note to self about yesterday's piece:
1. Long paragraphs, especially the last one. Make them shorter.
2. Used "but" too many times. My sentences need variety. 
3. Spellcheck!
