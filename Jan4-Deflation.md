## "What would anyone have a problem with deflation!? I don't."


### Story Time
Imagine this. You're killing it. You have a well-paying job, live in a nice apartment, even put money away into your retirement accounts already, but somehow you still driving your rusted 2003 Ford Pindo that you bought in your Sophomore Year many moons ago. You could afford to buy a much nicer car for about $15,000 - heck, even reasonably pay cash for it. 

But... what if I told you that if you hold off on that big ticket purchase for a month or two, you could probably get it for a couple thousand dollar less. 

After all, we live in deflationary times. The purchasing power of the dollars, rupees or Pesos in your pocket is rising by the day. You get more bang for your buck today than you did yesterday. That's how deflation work.

How cool is that?

If you hold off on buying that car for a year, maybe you could get it for $9,000. Who knows? Maybe a bit less!

In a deflation, it's not just the price of cars that fall. The general prices of good and services across the economy are in a downward trend.

Sounds great, right? What could possibly be wrong with things getting more and more affordable over time, right?


### Here's the problem...

In an economy, one person's spending is another person's income.

If you spend less money on something, the company that is selling it takes in less money and it sets of a chain reaction that is quite unpleasant.

Here's what happens when the vicious cycle of deflation takes hold:

1. The price of *Product X* drops. 
2. You need to spend fewer Dollars, Rupees or Pesos to buy X.
3. The company that makes X suffers because they now make less money than they used to. Revenues drop. Profits drop.
4. Due to falling profits, the company resorts to reducing expenses by laying off workers.
5. Laid off employees don't have as much money anymore and have to cut back on expenses, i.e. demand falls.
6. Employees that survived the lay off round fear they may be next and tighten their belts as well, i.e demand falls even further.
7. As we learned in Economics 101, when demand falls, companies try to attract buyers by lowering their prices.
8. Lower prices? Wait a second. Isn't that where we started on Step 1 of this vicious cycle?

### One More Thing
If you know we are in a deflationary period, wouldn't you be less likely to spend money to buy something today because you could buy even more of it with the money you have in the future. This disincentive reduces demand and leads to prices falling even further.


Note to self about yesterday's piece:
1. Long paragraphs, especially the last one. Make them shorter.
2. Used "but" too many times. My sentences need variety. 
3. Spellcheck!
