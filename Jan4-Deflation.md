## "Why would anyone have a problem with deflation!? I don't."


### Story Time

Imagine this. You're killing it. You have a well-paying job, live in a nice apartment, even put money into your retirement accounts every paycheck, but you're still driving your rusty 2003 Ford Pindo that you bought in your Sophomore Year many moons ago. You could reasonably afford to buy a much nicer car for about $15,000 today.

But... what if I told you that if you hold off on that big ticket purchase for a month or two, you could probably get it for a couple thousand dollars less. 

After all, in this hypothetical scenario, we live in deflationary times. The purchasing power of the dollars, rupees or Pesos in your pocket is rising by the day. You get more bang for your buck today than you did yesterday. That's how deflation works.

*How cool is that?*

If you hold off on buying that car for a year, maybe you could get it for $9,000. Who knows? Maybe a bit less!

In a deflationary environment, it's not just the price of cars that fall. The general prices of good and services across the economy are stuck in a downward trend.

Sounds great, right? What could possibly be wrong about things getting more and more affordable over time?


### Here's the problem...

In an economy, one person's spending is another person's income.

We often forget that basic concept.

If you spend less money on something, the company sells that to you takes in less money (revenue and profits drop) and it sets off a chain reaction that is quite unpleasant.

Here's what happens when the vicious cycle of deflation takes hold:

1. The price of `Product X` drops. 
2. You need to spend fewer Dollars, Rupees or Pesos to buy X.
3. The company that makes X suffers because they now make less money than they used to. Revenues drop. Profits drop.
4. Due to falling profits and maybe losses, the company resorts to cost cutting measures, including laying off workers.
5. Laid off employees don't have an income anymore and they naturally cut back on expenses, i.e. demand falls.
6. Employees that survived this round of lay offs fear they may be next and tighten their belts as well, i.e demand falls even further.
7. As we learned in Economics 101, when demand falls, companies try to attract buyers by lowering their prices.
8. Lower prices? Wait a second. Isn't that where we started on Step 1 of this vicious cycle?

### One More Thing
When we are in a deflationary cycle, people behaving rationally will think twice before making a purchase because they can buy it for cheaper tomorrow. This disincentive reduces demand today and leads to prices falling even further and faster.

As you can see a deflationary situation can get out of hand quite quickly. Once deflation takes hold, it is very hard to claw out of it -- even if you start throwing money out of helicopters.

Stay tuned for more articles I may write this month:
* Are we in a deflationary or inflationary era at the moment? 
* What are the deflationary and inflationary forces battling it out? Why isn't trillions of dollars in stimulus leading to even "2% inflation"?
* By the way, what is inflation anyway? Why can't economists agree on whether we have less than 2%, 8-12% or 24% inflation?
