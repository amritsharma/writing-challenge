## Fun and Games with Artificial Intelligence

#### Deep Blue v/s Garry Kasparov
In 1997, IBM's supercomputer called Deep Blue made history by defeating reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. This artificial intelligence was cutting edge for the time, but today's chess engines that can run on your cheap laptop would have no problem taking it on.

#### AlphaGo v/s Lee Sedol
In 2016, Google DeepMind's AlphaGo beat 18-time world champion Lee Sedol at the ancient game of Go. This feat shocked the world for a couple years. First, many thought this milestone was still many years away. Secondly, AlphaGo didn't just win the 5-match series convincingly, in Move 37 of Game 2, it demonstrated that AI can be creative. 

#### AlphaZero v/s AlphaGo
In 2017, DeepMind unveiled another AI. While AlphaGo was trained with large quantities of games under human supervision, this newcomer, AlphaZero, was self-taught. The Zero in AlphaZero means that the developers at Google DeepMind didn't teach it how to play chess. AlphaZero was given the rules of the game, without any more learning material. It learned by playing countless games against a slightly modified version of itself. Remarkable!

#### Google DeepMind v/s Capture The Flag
Unfortunately there's no cute name for this AI like *AlphaFlag*, but it's remarkable nonetheless and paved the way for AlphaStar later in the year. This AI was designed to handle a complicated real-time environment with other artificial and human players. The multiple AI "agents" must act independently yet interact and collaborate  with others. 

#### AlphaStar v/s Starcraft II
In December 2019, DeepMind was back with AlphaStar to take on the complex real-time multiplayer game, [Starcraft II](https://youtu.be/6eiErYh_FeY). Unlike chess or Go, there are hundreds of "pieces" on a Starcraft II board/screen at any time, each moving simultaneously as it's being controlled by another player. AlphaStar won most of it's games against the best human players in a "blind test" where the humans sometimes didn't know that they were playing against an AI.

Chess, Go, Capture The Flag and Starcraft II are all fun and games, but now these advancements in AI are  being directed towards more serious and life saving applications. In Nov 2020, Google DeepMind announced [AlphaFold](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology), an AI that had solved the "protein folding problem" grand challenge which had remained unsolved for the past 50 years. Time will only tell where these breakthroughs will take us, but with the pace of innovation at Google DeepMind, OpenAI and other organizations, it is an exciting time to be alive -- and thanks to the upcoming breakthroughs -- staying alive.
