## Artificial Intelligence

#### Deep Blue v/s Garry Kasparov
In 1997, IBM's supercomputer called Deep Blue made history by defeating reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. This artitifial intelligence was cutting edge for the time, but today's chess engines that can run on your cheap laptop would have no problem taking it on.

#### Alpha Go v/s Lee Sedol
In 2016, Google DeepMind's Alpha Go beat 18-time world champion Lee Sedol at the ancient game of Go. This feat shocked the world for a couple years. First, this milestone was still thought to have been many years away. Secondly, Alpha Go didn't just win the 5-match series convincingly, in Move 37 of Game 2, it demonstrated that AI can be creative. 

#### Alpha Zero v/s Alpha Go.
In 2017, DeepMind unveiled another AI. While Alpha Go was trained by feeding it large quantities of games under human supervision, this newcomer, Alpha Zero was self-taught. The Zero in Alpha Zero means that the developers at Google DeepMind didn't teach it how to play chess. Alpha Zero was given the rules of the game, without any more learning material. It learned by playing countless games against a slightly modified version of itself. When Scientific American covered the news of Alpha Zero defeating Alpha Go at chess, it was titled "AI versus AI: Self-Taught AlphaGo Zero Vanquishes Its Predecessor".
