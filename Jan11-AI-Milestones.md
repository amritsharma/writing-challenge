## Fun and Games with Artificial Intelligence

#### Deep Blue v/s Garry Kasparov
In 1997, IBM's supercomputer called Deep Blue made history by defeating reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. This artitifial intelligence was cutting edge for the time, but today's chess engines that can run on your cheap laptop would have no problem taking it on.

#### Alpha Go v/s Lee Sedol
In 2016, Google DeepMind's Alpha Go beat 18-time world champion Lee Sedol at the ancient game of Go. This feat shocked the world for a couple years. First, this milestone was still thought to have been many years away. Secondly, Alpha Go didn't just win the 5-match series convincingly, in Move 37 of Game 2, it demonstrated that AI can be creative. 

#### Alpha Zero v/s Alpha Go.
In 2017, DeepMind unveiled another AI. While Alpha Go was trained by feeding it large quantities of games under human supervision, this newcomer, Alpha Zero was self-taught. The Zero in Alpha Zero means that the developers at Google DeepMind didn't teach it how to play chess. Alpha Zero was given the rules of the game, without any more learning material. It learned by playing countless games against a slightly modified version of itself. When Scientific American covered the news of Alpha Zero defeating Alpha Go at chess, it was titled "AI versus AI: Self-Taught AlphaGo Zero Vanquishes Its Predecessor".

#### Google DeepMind v/s Capture The Flag
Unfortunately there's no cute name for this AI like Alpha Flag, but it's remarkable nontheless and paved the way for AlphaStar later in the year. This AI is designed to handle a complicated real-time environment with other artificial and human players. The multiple AI "agents" must act independently yet interact and collaborate  with others. 

#### Alpha Star v/s Starcraft II
In December 2019, DeepMind was back with AlphaStar to take on the complex real-time multiplayer game, [Starcraft II](https://youtu.be/6eiErYh_FeY). Unlike chess or Go, there are hundreds of "pieces" at any time on a Starcraft II board/screen each being controlled by another player and move simultaneous in real-time. Alpha Star won most of it's games against the best human players in a "blind test" where the humans sometimes didn't know that they were playing against an AI.

Chess, Go, Capture The Flag and Starcraft II are all fun and games, but these advancements in AI are now being turned towards more serious and life saving applications. In Nov 2020, Google DeepMind announced [AlphaFold](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology), an AI that had solved the "protein folding problem" grand challenge which had remained unsolved for the past 50 years. Time will only tell where these breakthroughs will take us, but with the pace of innovation at Google DeepMind, OpenAI and other organizations, it is an exciting time to be alive -- and thanks to the upcoming breakthroughs -- stay alive.
