## What the Hell is Inflation, Anyway?

*The headline is a throwback to 1994 when the Today Show hosts wondered [What is the internet, anyway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95-yZ-31j9A).*

It's quite surprising that such a foundational topic in economics can still be so mysterious. Inflation illicits strong emotions and can get people riled up -- and not just on twitter.

Why don't we have a common understanding of what inflation is, how it should be measured and consensus about what today's inflation rate is?

Is that really too much to ask?

It might be.

Disclaimer: This isn't an economics lesson. I am giving my writing muscles a workout here - that's it.

### So, what is inflation?
"No really, what is inflation really?," I asked my friend who has a knack for synthesizing complex ideas into a nutshell. "Too much money changes too few goods," he replied without missing a beat, without caring to elaborate.

"But what does that mean?"

...

I walked away from that conversation feeling dumb. I didn't get it. Is inflation the expansion of the money supply (aka, too much money)? Or, is it the rise in prices? Or, is the rise the prices just the consequence of inflation (too much money)?

Because there's "too much money" today than there was a year ago but the same economists are lamenting that there isn't enough inflation. It's weird.

Inflation, intuitively, is when it costs more money to buy something today than it used to. In other words, the purchasing power of the money has diminished.

### So, what is the inflation today?

Oh boy. Well, the official metric for measuring inflation is the CPI - it stand for the Consumer Price Index. It's designed to be the one metric that we supposed to consider the truth about inflation. But... well, it's not perfect.

Let's take a closer look.

#### 1) CPI 
Whether through CPI (consumer price index, but without food and energy) or the Chapwood Index?

College
Healthcare 
Food
Rent
House
Porque?

CPI says inflation is < 2%.

for a basket of good and services.

What's in the basket?

Wait a minute, that's it? 

How about A, B, C, D, ...

Nope. The Consumer Price Index doesn't look at those.

Well, duh! No wonder the inflation rate according to the CPI is so low. If you don't include many of the essential expenses a family has to incur every month, how are you supposed to get an inflation rate that reflects the reality of rising prices for a typical household?


#### 2) Chapwood Index
Sorry economists, when everyday people think of inflation we don't think of the CPI. Dr. Economist says inflation is sub 2% so I must be imagining the rising prices and my paycheck not going as far anymore. 

Intuitively we think of inflation  of it in these terms, not CPI. 

That's where the Chapwood Index comes in!

CPI says inflation is < 2%.

for a basket of good and services in a specific city.

INSERT CHART HERE.

But should we really be measuring inflation this way? (Maybe.) 

Is the Chapwood Index misleading? It's not a subjective equation. It performs a similar calculation to the CPI inflation rate, except it just defines the "basket of good and services" differently. 

As American philosopher, Lil Weezy, once said: "Men lie. Women lie. Numbers don't lie." Who would have thought? Numbers lie too.


### The nuances of inflation 
It's complicated. Shrinkflation? Big Macs...

Inflation is a sign of a healthy and growing economy. Quality of life rising. Wages rising. Cost of producing good rises. Prices rise. Money is changing hands often. One person's spending in another person's income. Economy is humming along. The virtuous cycle of inflation.

Hyperinflation is bad.
