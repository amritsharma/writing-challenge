## What the Hell is Inflation, Anyway?

*The headline is a throwback to 1994 when the Today Show hosts wondered [What is the internet, anyway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95-yZ-31j9A).*

It's quite surprising that such a foundational topic in economics can still be so mysterious. Inflation illicits strong emotions and gets people riled up -- and not just on twitter. 

Why don't we have a common understanding of what inflation is, how it should be measured and consensus about what today's inflation rate is?

Is that really too much to ask?

*sigh* It might be.

### So, what is inflation?
- more money changes fewer goods
- Rise in prices?
- Expansion of money supply?

### So, what is the inflation today?

"There is no inflation. We will overshoot inflation to get an average of 2% every year."

CPI says inflation is < 2%.

Inflation is a sign of a healthy and growing economy. Quality of life rising. Wages rising. Cost of producing good rises. Prices rise. Money is changing hands often. One person's spending in another person's income. Economy is humming along. The virtuous cycle of inflation.

#### 2) Chapwood Index
Sorry economists, when everyday people think of inflation we don't think of the CPI. Dr. Economist says inflation is sub 2% so I must be imagining the rising prices and my paycheck not going as far anymore. 

Intuitively we think of inflation  of it in these terms, not CPI. 

That's where the Chapwood Index comes in!

But is it accurate? It's not subjective. Men lie. Women lie. Numbers don't lie.

#### 3) Money Supply
