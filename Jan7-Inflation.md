## What is Inflation, Anyway?

*The headline is a throwback to 1994 when the Today Show hosts wondered "[what is the internet, anyway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95-yZ-31j9A)".*

It's quite surprising that such a foundational topic in economics can be so mysterious. Inflation illicits strong emotions and can get people riled up -- not just on twitter.

Why don't we have a common understanding of what inflation is, how it should be measured and what today's inflation rate is?

Is that really too much to ask?

It might be.

Disclaimer: This isn't an economics lesson. I am giving my writing muscles a workout here - that's it.

### So, what is inflation?

"No really, what is inflation really?," I asked my friend who has a knack for synthesizing complex ideas into a nutshell. "Too much money chasing too few goods," he replied without missing a beat.

"But what does that mean?"

Twenty minutes later, I walked away from that conversation feeling more confused than before. I didn't get it. Is inflation the expansion of the money supply (aka, too much money)? Or, is it the rise in prices? Or, is the rise the prices just the consequence of inflation (too much money)?

Because in 2021, there's "too much money" than there was a year ago but economists are lamenting that there isn't enough inflation. It's weird.

Inflation, intuitively, is when it costs more money to buy something today than it used to. In other words, the purchasing power of your money has diminished over time.

### So, what is the inflation today?

*Oh boy.* Well, the official metric for measuring inflation is the CPI - it stand for the Consumer Price Index. It's designed to be the one metric that we are supposed to consider the truth about inflation. But... well, it's not perfect.

Any inflation index takes a "basket of good" and whether they're more or less expensive now v/s before.

A common criticism of the CPI is that it undershoots inflation because it doesn't focus on the essential and most frequently goods that households typically spend money on. By tracking the change in prices of 80,000+ goods, the CPI distorts the inflation rate by diminishing the drastric rise in some goods.

CPI says inflation is < 2%. 

Meanwhile, the Chapwood Index uses an alternate basket of goods by focusing on the top 500 items on which Americans spend their after-tax dollars.

The Chapwood Index also recognizes that prices can vary drastrically depending on where you live. That's why it gathers and reports data for the 50 major cities in the States.

According to this index, inflation is between 8-12% in the major cities across the United States.

But should we really be measuring inflation this way? (Maybe.) 

Is the Chapwood Index misleading? It's not a subjective equation. It performs a similar calculation to the CPI inflation rate, except it just defines the "basket of good" differently. 

Just to be clear, there are [several legit reasons](https://www.bloombergquint.com/gadfly/as-the-stimulus-debate-rages-trust-government-inflation-numbers) to explain why the Chapwood Index overshoots inflation, much like the CPI undershoots it.

### The nuances of inflation 
Inflation is complicated. We haven't even talked about shrinkflation, which is when the price of an item doesn't rise but you get less of it for that same price.  Big Macs are a famous example of shrinkflation.

Inflation isn't necessary bad or harmful to an economy. Well, excessive inflation or deflation is certainly harmful.

Inflation (rising prices) is often a sign of a healthy and growing economy. When the economy is growing, the quality of life is rising. Employees demand and get higher wages as companies try to serve this market. As wages rise, so do the price tag on the goods. Voila. We have inflation. This is healthy because money is changing hands often. One person's spending in another person's income. The economy is humming along and the quality of life improves further.
