## What's Really In My Wealthsimple TFSA?

Wealthsimple in Canada is a no-brainer. It's a low bar but Wealthsimple offers the most millennial-friendly financial products in Canada. Their low fees, thoughtful UX and clever marketing make it the only choice for Canadians who want "set it and forget it" investments. That made it an attractive option for TFSAs, RRSPs and other accounts. I was in.

While setting up a TFSA account, all you have to do is answer a couple questions. It's simple - maybe too simple. 

(1) Pick a theme: Standard, Halal or Socially Responsible Investing.

(2) Risk level: 1-10.

I presume like any rational actor who is several decades away from retirement, I selected *Standard* and *10* to maximize my returns in exchange for higher risk.

Until today I never took the time to look beyond the pretty fonts and pastel colors on Wealthsimple to evaluate the specific ETFs that my money was being invested into. This is what I found.

Wealthsimple has allocated 90% of my portolfio into equities and the rest in bonds. 

### Equities (90%)

#### 1) U.S. equities. 22.5%. $VTI. [Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/vti).
Expense ratio: 0.03%.

This ETF is the fastest horse in the portfolio. It tracks the general moves of the US stock market and overweighs the largest companies which have had a great run recently. 5% of this portfolio is Apple. The top 10 holdings are mostly tech companies that are household names and pretty much run our lives now. Surprisingly Berkshire Hathaway and Johnson & Johnson are in there too. What makes this ETF most attractive is the exceptionally low fees. It's only 0.03%.

#### 2) International equities. 22.5%. $XEF. [BlackRock Canada iShares Core MSCI EAFE IMI Index ETF](https://www.blackrock.com/ca/investors/en/products/251421/ishares-msci-eafe-imi-index-etf).
Expense ratio: 0.22%.

Another 22.5% of my portfolio is in this international equities ETF. I was pleasantly surprised to see this. I had assumed that most of my money would be in US and Canadian companies only, but that's not the case. Nestle (Switzerland), ASML (Dutch telecom company), Toyota (Japan), Unilever (UK), SAP (Germany) and others make an appearance in the Top 10 of the holdings.

#### 6) US equities (CAD-hedged): 5.5%. $VUS. [Vanguard U.S. Total Market Index ETF (CAD-hedged)](https://www.vanguardcanada.ca/advisors/products/en/detail/etf/9551/equity)
Expense ratio: 0.16%

Vanguard U.S. Total Market Index ETF (CAD-hedged) seeks to track, to the extent reasonably possible and before fees and expenses, the performance of a broad U.S. equity index that measures the investment returns of primarily large-capitalization U.S. stocks, which index is hedged to the Canadian dollar. Currently, this Vanguard ETF seeks to track the CRSP US Total Market Index (CAD-hedged) (or any successor thereto). It invests directly or indirectly primarily in stocks of U.S. companies and uses derivative instruments to seek to hedge the U.S. dollar exposure of the securities included in the CRSP US Total Market Index to the Canadian dollar.

#### 2) Gold: 2.5%. $GLDM. [SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust](https://www.spdrgoldshares.com/gldm/)

The SPDRÂ® Gold MiniShares (NYSE Arca: GLDM) offers investors one of the lowest available expense ratios for a U.S. listed physically gold-backed ETF. GLDM may be beneficial to investors who intend to have long-term exposure to gold.

Questions:
1. What happens to the expense ratios of these ETFs after 2022 or 2023? Lower fees in the contract until then. 0.2 can reset to 0.7%.
2. Why bonds? 7% in bonds? Jeez.
3. ...
