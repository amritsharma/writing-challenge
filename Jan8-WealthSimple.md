## What's Really In My Wealthsimple TFSA?

Wealthsimple in Canada is a no-brainer. It's a low bar but Wealthsimple offers the most millennial-friendly financial products in Canada. Their low fees, thoughtful UX and clever marketing make it the only choice for Canadians who want "set it and forget it" investments. That made it an attractive option for TFSAs, RRSPs and other accounts. I was in.

While setting up a TFSA account, all you have to do is answer a couple questions. It's simple - maybe too simple. 

(1) Pick a theme: Standard, Halal or Socially Responsible Investing.

(2) Risk level: 1-10.

I presume like any rational actor who is several decades away from retirement, I selected *Standard* and *10* to maximize my returns in exchange for higher risk.

Until today I never took the time to look beyond the pretty fonts and pastel colors on Wealthsimple to evaluate the specific ETFs that my money was being invested into. This is what I found.

Wealthsimple has allocated 90% of my portolfio into equities and the rest in bonds. 

### Equities (90%)

#### 1) U.S. equities. 22.5%. $VTI. [Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/vti).
Expense ratio: 0.03%.

This ETF is the fastest horse in the portfolio. It tracks the general moves of the US stock market and overweighs the largest companies which have had a great run recently. 5% of this portfolio is Apple. The top 10 holdings are mostly tech companies that are household names and pretty much run our lives now. Surprisingly Berkshire Hathaway and Johnson & Johnson are in there too. What makes this ETF most attractive is the exceptionally low fees. It's only 0.03%.

#### 2) International equities. 22.5%. $XEF. [BlackRock Canada iShares Core MSCI EAFE IMI Index ETF](https://www.blackrock.com/ca/investors/en/products/251421/ishares-msci-eafe-imi-index-etf).
Expense ratio: 0.22%.

Another 22.5% of my portfolio is in this international equities ETF. I was pleasantly surprised to see this. I had assumed that most of my money would be in US and Canadian companies only, but that's not the case. Nestle (Switzerland), ASML (Dutch telecom company), Toyota (Japan), Unilever (UK), SAP (Germany) and others make an appearance in the Top 10 of the holdings.

##### 3) Emerging market equities: 16.9%. $EEMV. [BTC iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol Emerging Markets ETF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239641/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-minimum-volatility-etf).
Expense ratio: 0.25%

This ETF holds a wide selection of companies in the emerging markets. As you can see in the list below, the companies here aren't sexy but are steady. Boring companies that have been around for a long time deserve a spot in a portfolio that one intends to buy and hold for decades.

#### 4) Canadian equities: 11.3%. $XIC. [BlackRock iShares Core S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index ETF](https://www.blackrock.com/ca/investors/en/products/239837/ishares-sptsx-capped-composite-index-etf).
Expense ratio: 0.06

Oh Canada! Let's be honest. We should be counting our lucky stars everyday that Shopify is a Canadian company. If it wasn't for it, I would be upset that I have a piece of this ETF.

#### 5) Global equities: 11.3%. ACWV. [BTC iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol Global ETF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239605/ishares-msci-all-country-world-minimum-volatility-etf).
Expense ratio: 0.20%.

This ETF is similar to the International Equities ETF above. It contains a diverse array of companies across many countries and offers key diversification with low fees that one craves in a retirement portfolio.

#### 6) US equities (CAD-hedged): 5.5%. $VUS. [Vanguard U.S. Total Market Index ETF (CAD-hedged)](https://www.vanguardcanada.ca/advisors/products/en/detail/etf/9551/equity)
Expense ratio: 0.16%

This ETF with American equities is identical to the $VIS above. Tech companies that have dominated the markets in past couple decades make up the majority of this ETF as well.

### Fixed income & Gold (10%)

#### 1) Government bonds: 7.5%. $ZFL. BMO Long Federal Bond ETF.

Bonds, Government bonds! 7% of the portfolio in bonds seems excessive, but I'm biased because we've seen equities rally relentlessly in recent memory and it's hard to imagine why a dollar in bonds wouldn't be better suited in a stock instead.


#### 2) Gold: 2.5%. $GLDM. [SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust](https://www.spdrgoldshares.com/gldm/)

Gold is a relatively new addition to the Wealthsimple TFSA mix. Low interest rates, loose monetary policies and dwindling purchasing power of fiat currencies worldwide make gold an attractive and necessary part of any diversified portfolio.


Questions:
1. What happens to the expense ratios of these ETFs after 2022 or 2023? Lower fees in the contract until then. 0.2 can reset to 0.7%.
2. ...
