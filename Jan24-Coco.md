How are you doing today?

Listen. I know 2020 was a challenging year. 2021 is also pretty strange. 

The physical distancing, waiting for vaccines, not knowing when we will see our friends again and so much more. But you are fighting through it. I am sure you are following your local COVID-19 health guidelines, showing up to work (or school) on Zoom and doing your best. Yay you!

The pandemic has certainly taken a toll on our minds, but did you know that while we are sitting at our desks (ok fine, couch) at home, we are also destroying our bodies - [quite literally](https://www.vice.com/en/article/4aynaw/working-from-home-is-leading-to-neck-back-pain-health-issues). Problems like insomnia, back pain, hunched over and stiff shoulders, aching eyes and so much more are plaguing many of us because we're stuck at home and not doing much. :(

This is a BIG deal.

Taking care of yourself is the best "developer productivity" life hack in the world. We all know that we should drink more water, stretch, take breaks, ... but it's tough to remember to do them all the time, right?

Well, Coco is here for you. üê∂

Every morning, Coco will send you a gentle message in a private slack channel to remind you to take care of yourself and to help kick start your day on the right foot.

*wags*

-Coco.
