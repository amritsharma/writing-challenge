#### What's going well? 
* Consistency. Writing and publishing daily.
* Writing gears churing more than before. I'm still rusty.
* Considering that I spend less than 2 hours working on each of the pieces from idea to tweet, they're pretty good. But this format of publishing daily isn't great for producing high quality pieces. I suppose that's fine for now. As long as I keep flexing my writing muscles, this is a win.


#### Things to change/improve:
* Pick a narrow topic intead of a broad one. "What is Inflation, Anyway?" was too broad.
* Late night writing is screwing up my sleep schedule. It's 11:30pm right now and I haven't started writing.
* Publish these posts on Medium?
* Write less about economics.  Write more about tech.
* Edit posts from previous days.
* My writing style is very "me". I write in my voice. More often than not, it tends to sound like an opinion piece in a newspaper. It's a writing style that works for some articles - but it should be one of several styles in my writing toolkit. For instance, this first person POV doesn't serve me well for writing technical API documentation.
* I didn't do any research before starting to write my articles on deflation or inflation. The deflation piece turned out fine, but I didn't quite find my feet and figure out what I was trying to say about inflation. I could improve that by writing about a topic I've read/researched recently.


#### Writing crutches.
* unsure when to use "-"
* unsure when to use "--"
* excessive use of "great"
* excessive use of "amazing"
* excessive use of "awesome"
* excessive use of "but" 
* first person POV
* excessive use of "also"
* 
* 
* 
* 

#### More writing ideas.
* Whatsapp or Signal?
* Explaining Bitcoin.
