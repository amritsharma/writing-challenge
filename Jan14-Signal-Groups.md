Congrats! You did it. You signed up for Signal and are ready to quit Whatsapp.

There's only one problem.

*Network effects!*

Your friends, family, uncle that's not really your uncle but a family friend and your elderly relatives are still Whatsapp. 

That's network effects.

You've made the move over to Signal, but so what? A messaging app is only truly useful if all your contacts make the jump over with you to Signal (not Telegram or some other messaging app). And not to mention who wants to use two messaging apps and keep track of which ones of your folks have made the jump over from the dark side.
