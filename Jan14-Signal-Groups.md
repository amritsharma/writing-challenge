## How To Easily Move Group Chats from Whatsapp to Signal? (Without Copy and Pasting)

Congrats! You did it. You signed up for Signal and are ready to quit Whatsapp.

There's only one problem.

*Network effects!*

YOU have made the move to Signal, but your friends, family, uncle that's not really a relative but a family friend and your elderly  are still using Whatsapp. 

Ugh.

That's network effects.

A messaging app is only truly useful if all your contacts (and conversations) make the jump over with you to Signal.

### Group Chats

A popular feature within Whatsapp is the Group Chats. You can easily stay in touch a few friends, colleagues, family members, old buddies from uni or your *gulp* soon-to-be in-laws. It's not unique to Whatsapp and isn't innovative by any means but is very handy -- especially in a global pandemic!

For every group you have on Whatsapp, we're going to follow these simple steps to move them over to Signal. These steps are for Android, but a similar workflow applies to iOS devices as well.


**Step 1.** Create New Group on Signal. Tap on the ellipses and select "New group" from the menu.  


**Step 2.** Tap "Skip" on the add contacts screen. Choose a name for your group on the "Name this group" screen.

**Step 3.** Enable "Group Link" by clicking on ellipses and "Group Settings". You have the option to approve everyone who tries to join this Signal Group using this URL. If you're only sharing this with your existing contacts in a specific Whatsapp Group, there is no need to approve new group members.

**Step 5.** When everyone has successfully moved from your group in Whatsapp to Signal turn off `Group Link` by toggling it to off.   

That's it.
