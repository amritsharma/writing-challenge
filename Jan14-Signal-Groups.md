Congrats! You did it. You signed up for Signal and are ready to quit Whatsapp.

There's only one problem.

*Network effects!*

YOU have made the move to Signal, but... your friends, family, uncle that's not really your uncle but a family friend and your elderly relatives are still using Whatsapp. 

Ugh.

That's network effects.

A messaging app is only truly useful if all your contacts make the jump over with you to Signal (not Telegram or some other messaging app). Also who wants to use two messaging apps and keep track of which ones of your folks have made the jump over from the dark side?

1. Create Group on Signal.

2. Turn on sharing.

3. Grab URL and adjust for privacy.

3. Share URL on Whatsapp group. 

4. Turn off sharing.
